# Magnetic frustration as a guide to quantum circuit design

One of the potential benefits of quantum machine learning (QML) is the ability to leverage the exponentially large Hilbert space of quantum systems to represent and learn complex patterns from data that may be classically intractable. However, QML algorithms can also suffer from barren plateaus (regions in the optimization landscape wherein the gradient vanishes), making learning and training extremely difficult and heavily dependent on parameter initialization. The goal of this project is to utilize concepts from condensed matter physics, specifically magnetic frustration, as a naive conceptual guide to circumvent this pitfall and create expressive quantum circuits and algorithms.

As an initial test, this project focuses on image augmentation and convolutions to extract image features by adapting the principles behind the frustrated J1-J2 square-lattice Hamiltonian to convolutional kernels.
